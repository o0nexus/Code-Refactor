# Code-refactor

## Description

As a marketing agency we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines. The source code will be reviewed and semantic HTML elements will be applied. The elements will follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning. Icon and image elements will have accessible alt attributes. Heading attributes will fall in sequential order. The title element will have a concise name.
